## Adding new comparisons

All comparisons are sorted into folders that correspond to the country that is most relevant to the comparison. If the comparison is relevant to multiple countries, it should be placed in the folder of a higher level entity, like EU or World.

To add a new comparison, add a new entry to the comparisons array and fill out all the fields.

Choose an appropriate actual source like Overpass or Taginfo.

Write a funny description and add tags.

The selected tags need to be present or added to the `tags.json` file.
