# the future dreams of this project

in this document i will write down some ideas i have for this project.

## the cia world factbook

I am currently working on a script that would use some of the facts in the cia factbook to compare to osm.

I am focusing on the power generation section, because it is the most interesting to me.

its current state can be found in the `collect/countries/fromSource/factbook` file. Im stuck on how to get the data out of osm because the power generation is duplicated on for example the generator and the site.

## statistics sites

there are many sites offering statistics. they are often government or ngo sites. they often have a lot of data, but it is often hard to get to. i would like to make a script that can get data from these sites.
